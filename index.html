            <p>Harihar fort was built during the Seuna (Yadava) dynasty period. It was surrendered to Khan Zamam in 1636 along with Trymbak and other Pune forts.[1] The fort was captured by Captain Briggs[2] in 1818 along with 17 other forts.</p>

    <p>Kalavantin Durg is a 2,250 ft (686 m) high summit located in the Western Ghats, near the Prabalgad fort in the Raigad district of Maharashtra, India. It is also known as Kelve Teen, Kalavantinicha Sulka, or Kalavantin Pinnacle; alternative transliterations include Kalawantin, Kalavati, and Kalavanti. It is a popular trekking destination.</p>    
    <p>There is a series of steps leading to the top of the pinnacle, but little is known about the history of the structure. According to local guides, it was built for a queen called Kalavantin in the 15th century, around the same time as the neighboring Prabalgad.[1]

        In Marathi language the word "Durg" means fort. Although it is called "Kalavantin Durg", there is no fort. Kalavantin is a pinnacle which was used by the ruler to have watch on surrounding area.</p>
